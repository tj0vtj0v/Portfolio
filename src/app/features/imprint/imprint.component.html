    <p><strong>Accountability for content</strong></p>
    <p>
        The contents of these pages have been created with the utmost care. However, I cannot guarantee the accuracy,
        completeness, or topicality of the (external) contents.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Accountability for links</strong></p>
    <p>
        Responsibility for the content of external links (to web pages of third parties) lies solely with the operators
        of the linked pages. No violations were evident at the time of linking. Should any legal infringement become
        known, I will remove the respective link immediately.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
    <p>
        All web pages and their contents are subject to international copyright law. Unless expressly permitted
        by law, any form of utilization, reproduction, or processing of works subject to copyright protection on these
        web pages requires explicit prior consent. Individual reproductions of a work are allowed only for private use
        and must not directly or indirectly serve earnings purposes. Unauthorized use of copyrighted works is
        punishable.

    <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
    <p>
        A visit to this website without authentication does not result in the storage of access information on our
        server. However, other service providers may store such information. All data stored by myself is guaranteed to
        be kept as secure as possible, following industry best practices as of the day the service was created. This
        does not imply any analysis of the collected personal data.
    </p>
    <p>
        I expressly point out that the transmission of data via the Internet can have security vulnerabilities. It is
        therefore impossible to fully safeguard data against third-party access. I cannot assume liability for damages
        resulting from such security vulnerabilities.
